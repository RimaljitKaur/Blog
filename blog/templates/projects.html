        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Over the last couple of years I worked on a number of open source projects. Most of them were Python, a couple of others however were also C, C++, JavaScript, PHP or other languages mixed in. Talks I held have been moved to a new place on this website.</p>
        <p>This list is widely incomplete, lots of small things can be found on my github profile and some things are lost in the depths of the internet.</p>
        <p>Projects I've founded are marked with stars (‘*’), others are project I joined. Projects where I helped out for a short period of time are marked with a dagger (‘†’).</p>
